# Visualizations tutorial

1. **doRunGUI.py** is a simple script demonstrating the online visualization of a model parameters while the model is being estimated.

2. **doPlotResults.py** is another simple script generating figures from the estimated model.

3. **report/latentsReport.tex** is a latex source that shows the previous figures, with hyperlinks to interactive html figures.

Enjoy.
