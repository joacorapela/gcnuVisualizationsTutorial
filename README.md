1. doRunGUI.py is a simple script demonstrating the visualization of model outputs while they are running.

2. doPlotResults.py is another simple scripts generating figures that visualize the estimated model.

3. report/latentsReport.tex is the latex source that shows the previous figures, with hyperlinks to interactive html figures.
